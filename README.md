# OCamlot : OCaml Online Testing

## Usage

This early version of ocamlot is intended to be used solely as
command-line driven automation. OCamlot expects to operate in the root
of its checked out repository where it has been built with `make` and it
will store its working copies under the subdirectory `work`.
