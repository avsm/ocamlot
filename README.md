# OCamlot : OCaml Online Testing

## Usage

This early version of ocamlot is intended to be used solely as
command-line driven automation while the service infrastructure is being
written. You will also need to use the ocaml-github Github auth
token cookie jar with a local token named 'OCamlPro/opam-repository' to grant Github
access.
